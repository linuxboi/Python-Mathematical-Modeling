# Python-Mathematical-Modeling
This project is a Python traffic simulation system that models and visualizes flow across infrastructures like roundabouts, onramps, diverging diamonds, and two-way intersections. Built on the trafficSimulator package, it covers road geometry, vehicle behavior, traffic signals, generation, and visualization.
